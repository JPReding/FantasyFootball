<h2 align="center" >2019 Family Fantasy Football</h2>
Hope everyone's offseason was productive and we've learned a lot since letting the <a href="http://fantasy.espn.com/football/team?leagueId=215530&seasonId=2019&teamId=12" target="_blank">"Auto Draft King"</a> beat us in fantasy football.

I thought it would be fun to have a central place to document all the story lines, prizes, and history our time chasing fantasy glory.
