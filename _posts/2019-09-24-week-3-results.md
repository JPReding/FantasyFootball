What a shake up this week was. All the 0-2 teams got a win this week, except Rob (sorry!), and all the 2-0 teams were handed their first loss, except Emily (watch out!).

## Story Lines
---
- Jonathan’s team woke up and realized they had talent, finally securing a win over Daniel in strong fashion. 
- Emily dominated Courtney in large part to her Panther’s players looking strong against Arizona. Emily now sits alone at the top at 3-0.
- David was this week’s high scorer! Mike Evans alone provided a 37 point boost as he crushed Davis to claim his first victory of the season.
- Jeremy’s day ended abruptly when Saquon Barkley was injured early and was promptly handed his first loss of the season as the Hines finished strong to claim their first victory in a surprising upset over last year’s defending champ. 
- KB continues to looks solid as Rob keeps searching for the gas pedal to get his team moving in the right direction. 0-3 is a tough start to the season. 
- Paul was aided by the changes in New York as Evan Engram had a huge day with the new rookie QB. Paul and Joel are now tied at 2-1 on the season and both looking pretty solid as contenders for the rest of the season.
