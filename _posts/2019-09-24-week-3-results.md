- David was this week’s high scorer! Mike Evans alone provided a 37 point boost as he crushed Davis to claim his first victory of the season.
- Jeremy’s day ended abruptly when Saquon Barkley was injured early and has handed his first loss of the season as the Hines finished strong to claim their first victory in a surprising upset over last year’s defending champ. 
- KB continues to looks solid as Rob keeps searching for the gas pedal to get his team moving in the right direction. 0-3 is a tough start to the season.
- Paul was aided by the changes in New York as Evan Engram had a huge day with the new rookie QB. Paul and Joel are now tied at 2-1 on the season and both looking pretty solid as contenders for the rest of the season.
