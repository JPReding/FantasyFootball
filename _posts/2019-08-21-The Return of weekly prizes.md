Who else enjoyed the weekly prizes as an added wrinkle to salvage an otherwise potentially obismal week?

**Weekly $5 prizes** will return this season, but I need help with prize ideas (I even need help remembering the prizes we did last year). Help me out by tossing a few ideas in to this google form whenever you get some inspriation.
