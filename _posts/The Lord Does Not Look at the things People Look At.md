This has been a bittersweet week. My wife's grandfather passed away on Good Friday and we went to honor his life and celebrate his legacy. It's hard to let go of a man whose heart was so strong and loving to his family. 

I consider myself lucky to have married in to this family. Blessed even greater to get to spend time with Phil while his mind was still unaffected me the god-forsaken disease of Alzheimer's. 

Phil had a small frame, a tender voice, and iron sharp wit. He never ran out of funny comment and I never heard him complain. Even in the final 3 years where he had constant spouts of disillusionment and confusion where he didn't know or recognize any face or location, even still he was kind and humorous. 

I didn't expect to be so emotional about his passing. I do not enjoy funerals, as I imagine that no one really does enjoy funerals. The eerie silence of a breathless body, unrepresentative of the life that once filled that shell is hard for me to behold. 

The body in the casket didn't resemble Phil. I am grateful that Phil's soul has been freed from the burden of being trapped in that frame. 

Along with the many stories told of his kindness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control... my tears flowed from the memories I shared personally with Phil during my time in Lubbock. 

Phil was my favorite person to watch the Cowboys with during their 13-3 season when Romo first took over the reigns of the team. That season was filled with miraculous comeback after comeback to the point that the team was referred to as the "Cardiac Cowboys." As great as that season was, I suspect that we both enjoyed the games primarily for the mere fact that it gave us a reason to be together. 

Each visit resulted in being showered with praise and encouragement from Phil. He would never stop complimenting and saying kind things about my relationship his granddaughter, now my wife.
