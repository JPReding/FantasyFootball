Doesn't look like there is any block of time where we got 100% availability. That being the case, the draft is scheduled for **Sunday, August 25, 2019 at 9:15 CST/8:15 MDT.**

At least Jeremy has proven time and again that you can win by auto-drafting so if you have to miss out on the fun, you still have hope.
