## Story Lines
---

- Davis winning convincingly over Jonathan riding the Patriots defense for 35 points alone. Jonathan looks to be in serious trouble on the season.
- Daniel gets his first win as Courtney stumbles this week. Both go to 1-1 on the season.
- Emily is proving to be a force to be reckoned with even when the Panthers struggle, she moves to 2-0 on the season as David joins Jonathan at 0-2.
- Jeremy looks stout again this year. Not even Rob's strong last second flair in OBJ could overcome Jeremy's high score. 
- Paul is looking to right the ship as he doubles the Hines score and with the win moves to 1-1. Hines joining Jonathan in the 0-2 club. 
- Joel proves to be KB's kryptonite as a late scoring adjustment on a Bell fumble gets applied and he snatches the lead on Monday night. Joel quietly moving to 2-0.
