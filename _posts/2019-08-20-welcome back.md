Welcome back everyone to our 11th season of the Family Fantasy Football league. 

#### First things first, the draft. 

I’ve selected a two week range of dates to choose from starting on **Thursday (8/22) and before the *start of the regular season* (9/4)**.


The 2019 regular season kicks off on Thursday September 5th

<p class="callout"> FYI, preseason ends August 29th if you’re worried about any last second preseason injuries affecting your draft. </p>

#### Ok, so here’s what you need to do:

1. Click <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?7954618-Azx3U" target="_blank">here</a> to go the *When2Meet* tool
2. “Sign in” with your name *(no password needed)*
3. Then select the time blocks you are available

That’s it. 

As we all fill in availability it will create a “heat map” to the right of your selections showing when the best time will be to schedule the live draft.

Here’s the short <a href="https://v.usetapes.com/5mRS2iP1pM" target="_blank">demo video</a> I made last year in case you forgot how to meet the tool

#### Pro Tips

- Click and drag to select times. 
- If you need to change availability at a later date (before the draft is scheduled) then just follow the link again and sign in again with your name (still no password needed).
