### Welcome back everyone to our 11th season of the Family Fantasy Football league. 

#### First things first, the draft. 
![alt text](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwir5fLX99DjAhXrmeAKHcNvBWAQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2846323-fantasy-football-2019-predicting-the-biggest-breakouts&psig=AOvVaw1uK5Qvz-JNI6Nn4JnpGYRM&ust=1564173810620478)

I’ve selected a two week range of dates to choose from starting on **Thursday (8/22) and before the *start of the regular season* (9/4)**.


The 2019 regular season kicks off on Thursday September 5th

```FYI, preseason ends August 29th if you’re worried about any last second preseason injuries affecting your draft.```

#### Ok, so here’s what you need to do:

1. Click [here](https://www.when2meet.com/?7954618-Azx3U) to go the tool *When2Meet*
2. “Sign in” with your name *(no password needed)*
3. Then select the time blocks you are available

That’s it. 

As we all fill in availability it will create a “heat map” to the right of your selections showing when the best time will be to schedule the live draft.

Here’s the short [demo video](https://v.usetapes.com/5mRS2iP1pM) I made last year in case you forgot how to meet the tool

#### Pro Tips

- Click and drag to select times. 
- If you need to change availability at a later date (before the draft is scheduled) then just follow the link again and sign in again with your name (still no password needed).
