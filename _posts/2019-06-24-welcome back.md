Welcome back everyone to our 11th season of the Family Fantasy Football league. 


We’ve selected a range of dates to choose from starting this next Sunday (8/26) and before the *start of the regular season* (9/6).

FYI, preseason ends August 30th if you’re worried about any last second preseason injuries affecting your draft.

Ok, so here’s what you need to do:

1. Click the link (https://www.when2meet.com/?7013092-44Lpc)
2. “Sign in” with your name (no password needed)
3. Then select the time blocks you are available

That’s it. It should create a “heat map” to the right of your selections showing when the best time will be to schedule the live draft.

Here’s a short demo video I made in case you get confused

If you need to change availability at a later date (before the draft is scheduled) then just follow the link again and sign in again with your name (no password needed).
