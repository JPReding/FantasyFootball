## Story Lines
---
- Despite a 36.3pt performance by Nick Chubb, David killed his dream of win #2 when the Chicago Bears defense put on a clinic.
- Daniel and Emily went head to head for the first time and as a result of "Run CMC" looking human for Emily, Daniel squeaked in a W and hand Emily her first loss of the season. 
- Davis seems to be returning to the form of seasons pasts and dropping a second loss on Courtney. A 23pt NE defensive performance anchoring a solid win against a tough opponent.
- After a stunning loss in the prior week, Jeremy was handed another one by KB. Ito Smith didn't have what it takes to replace an injured Saquon Barkley.
- Joel continues to impress this season earning a W against the Hines and moving up the standings into a first place spot at 3-1
- Paul is on a 3 game winning streak and also moving to a first place spot at 3-1 on the season. Rob is still seeking that first win in his worst season to date.
