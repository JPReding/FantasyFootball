Checked in with Davis after seeing the [playoff projections](https://sportsfamily.club/2019/08/27/draft-results.html) based on our initial draft. Four teams entering the tournament didn't seem right after the league expanded to 12 teams.  

#### Our Historical Schedule & Playoff Bracket

Expanding the playoff showdown to six teams felt like a better opportunity for competition to thrive. So here is the proposed expansion of the playoffs:
#### New Schedule & Playoff Bracket

In order to shift to a 6 team playoff, it does bring interesting changes:

- Playoffs will start 1 week later (week 15, not week 14)
- No. 1 and No 2. seeds will start with a bye week in week 15
- Playoffs will now be single elimination weeks 

This winner takes all playoff will certainly open the door for some upsets. 

I would love to hear feedback before the seasons starts. There some tradeoffs, but ultimately I think this will make for a more exciting fantasy season. The champion will be whoever can maintain the best strategy throughout the seasons, especially as real NFL teams start to rest starters before the playoffs.
