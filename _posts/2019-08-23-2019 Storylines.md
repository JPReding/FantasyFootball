As we anticiapte the draft and start of the season, here are some notes from Davis regarding the upcoming season.

___

- Jeremy won his unprecedented 3rd straight title last season. Can the league end his reign of terror?
- Paul followed his 3 straight seasons of runner-up status with a 1-12 meltdown in 2018. Will he return to form?
- KB finished her inaugural season as the runner-up much to Jonathan’s chagrin. She's tapping out with the highest overall winning percentage in league history. We welcome Emily in to the league, will she be an even fiercer opponent than KB?
- The Hines look to make their 1st career playoff appearance, while Daniel and Joel aim to end playoff droughts dating back to 2013 and 2014 respectively
- Free Agent Frenzy: League activity saw a major uptick last season, with 271 Free Agent acquisitions throughout the year! Thanks to all who stayed active, despite the fact that it made me finish 8th. Let’s do it again this year!
