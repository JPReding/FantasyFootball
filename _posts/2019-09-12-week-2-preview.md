## Developing Story Lines

- Emily is riding high from a dominent win, will David's projections prove true this week for his first win?
- Rob and Jeremy look evenly matched. This will be a good one to watch it shake out.
- Paul vs. the Hines, one team will emerge with their first victory. Who will it be?
- KB is feeling bold after winning the prize for the highest scoring team, will Joel repeat last season's unlikely victory? The projections look to be too close to call!
