Doesn't look like there is any block of time where we got 100% availability. That being the case, the draft is scheduled for **Sunday, August 25, 2019 at 9:15 CST**

For the sake of clarity, since we are getting more spread out time zone wise please double check your time zone.
- 8:15pm MST
- 9:15pm CST
- 10:15pm EST 

**DRAFT IS TONIGHT**

At least Jeremy has proven time and again that you can win by auto-drafting ðŸ’¥. Thus, if you have to miss out on the fun, you still have hope.
