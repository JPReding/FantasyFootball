- The brother battle between Daniel and David didn't provide much drama as Daniel crushed David this week.
- Emily somehow secured her 4th win against Davis despite three starters scoring a combined total of 0 points.
- Jeremy is on a 3 week losing skid, as Joel marches on to 4-1.
- Paul was the highest scoring team this week and is now on a not so quiet 4 game winning streak.
- The Hines were just 2 points away from being the highest scoring team this week. They crushed Rob earning their second win, meanwhile Rob is still seeking that elusive first win.

The highest scoring loser was Davis. Hopefully this helps soften the blow that Emily won while posting 3 donuts on the starting roster.
